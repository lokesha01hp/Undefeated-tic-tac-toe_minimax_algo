# 🎮 Ultimate Tic Tac Toe Showdown 🧠

Welcome to the most **ruthless** game of Tic Tac Toe you've ever played.

This isn't your grandma's Tic Tac Toe. This is a battle-hardened, brain-flexing AI challenge designed to humiliate any human who dares to face it. Built with Python, this game doesn't just play — it **thinks**.

## 💡 Why This Project Is Different

Most Tic Tac Toe projects are either:
- ✅ too basic (hard-coded AI with no brains),
- ❌ beatable (predictable, dumb logic),
- 💤 or just boring (no modes, no fun).

**But not this one.**

This one comes loaded with:
- 🔁 Multiple game modes (Human vs Human, Human vs AI, Human vs RandomBot)
- 🧠 A super-smart AI powered by the Minimax algorithm
- 🎲 A random bot for chaos-lovers
- 🎯 Clean command-line visuals
- 🔄 AI self-play mode for testing performance
- 💥 Game results with stats

## 🧠 How Minimax algorithm works

The **Minimax algorithm** is a decision rule used for minimizing the possible loss in a worst-case scenario and maximizing the win during the best-case. 

### How it works:
- The AI simulates every possible move.
- It assumes **you’re trying to win** (so it plans accordingly).
- It then chooses the move that **minimizes your chance to win** and **maximizes its own**.

It doesn't just react.  
It **strategizes**.  
And unless you play *perfectly*, you **will not win**.

## 🏆 Efficiency: AI Performance Results

We put the Smart AI to the test.  
And let's just say... it's built different.

### 🤖 SmartAI vs SmartAI (1000 games)
```
X wins: 0
O wins: 0
Ties: 1000
```
🧠 The AI plays so perfectly, neither side can win. Pure strategy equilibrium. You can’t beat it — you can only **tie**.

---

### 🧠 SmartAI vs RandomBot (1000 games)
```
X (SmartAI) wins: 960
O (RandomBot) wins: 0
Ties: 40
```
🎯 The SmartAI *destroys* the random bot, 96% win rate. That’s efficiency you can trust.
